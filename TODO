NEED TO HANDLE CASE WHERE SITE IS CURRENTly DOWN AND OUTAGE ISN'T YET PACKAGED AND SAVED TO DB

Cache calculations until next outage


FIX STARTUP -> JUST NEED TO SEE IF THERE'S AN UNLOGGED OUTAGE SINCE LAST OUTAGE BY CHECKING LAST UP AGAINST LAST OUTAGE END
    IF DOWN SINCE LAST END THEN IN OUTAGE AND START IT MINUTE AFTER LAST LOGGED UP





PERCENTAGE CALCULATION NOT DISPLAYING IN JSON

DB 1: Cache of last week of results for data rebuild in event of crash
    - Used to find_one() for last result 

DB 2: Database of all outages:
    - {"outage_start": datetime_start, "outage_end": datetime_end}

Startup validation:
    - Check last result from weekly db.
    - If last down, rebuild outage detection from the weekly db (find last up result)
    - If last result is up, proceed as ususal

Background worker:
    - Write results to db
    - Write outage start/end to db on outage end

ALL:
    - Check for orphaned TODO tags

Optimization (DO IT LAST, YOU IDIOT):
    REDUCE DATA USAGE
        U/D instead of UP/DOWN
        Cut a ton of data out of the datetimes
